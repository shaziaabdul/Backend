            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The iPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a computer, iPod, digital camera and cellular
                phone into one device with a touchscreen interface. The iPhone runs the iOS operating system, and in
                2021 when the iPhone 13 was introduced, it offered up to 1 TB of storage and a 12-megapixel camera.

                The original iPhone was announced on Jan. 9, 2007, at the Macworld convention by Apple co-founder Steve
                Jobs. While it was not considered the first smartphone, the iPhone has helped drive the global shift to
                mobile computing among both consumers and businesses. Its primary rival has been Google Android-based
                devices from companies such as Samsung, also introduced in 2007.</p>
